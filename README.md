This is a little project looking into how to create a simple proxy in GOLANG which will transform the body of HTTP requests and responses.  The transforms will be controlled by an API. The initial idea is to the support the following transformations:

**JSON** via JavaScript Engine using Chrome V8

**XML** via XSLT Engine using the native libxslt
